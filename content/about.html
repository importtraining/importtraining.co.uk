            <h3 style="text-align: center;">We help you develop the skills you
            need to do the stuff you care about.</h3>

            <p>We start with what you care about, then deliver courses that
            address your needs.</p>

            <p>We're student focussed to ensure we create an environment in
            which you'll flourish. You won't find us parachuting in to
            perform
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerpoint-Karaoke">PowerPoint Karaoke</a>!</p>

            <p>We supply teaching and learning that improves your skills,
            challenges you to develop and gives you the autonomy to sustain
            your progress.</p>

            <p>We are also currently active developers with up-to-date
            expertise, links into the wider software development community and
            track records delivering software in a wide variety of business
            environments.</p>

            <p>Finally, we engage with you to ensure you're getting the best
            from our training.</p>

                    </ul>

                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How do we Deliver?</h2>

            <p>We're teach using a blend of different styles to suit both the
            subject matter and students. This may range from simple exercises,
            pair programming, dojo style group work, peer-review, self
            assessment and, of course, good old chalk'n'talk.</p>

            <p>We make our classes simple and easy to follow and cover subjects
            from the simplest to most complex. We never make things more
            complicated than they need to be and we're atuned to our student's
            backgrounds so we can work with them to improve from their current
            situation.</p>

            <p>Finally, we work hard to place our training into a context that
            is meaningful for our students. This is important because we
            believe we succeed when our graduates have the confidence to
            continue to learn and develop autonomously within their working
            environment.</p>

            <h2>Work with Us!</h2>

            <p>We don't just deliver off-the-shelf courses. We also enjoy
            working with organisations that require bespoke training. Check out

            this works.</p>
