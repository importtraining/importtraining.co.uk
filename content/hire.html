            <p>We love working with organisations to help them plan and
            deliver bespoke training as per our philosophy set out in our
            <a href="/about">about page</a>.</p>

            <p>For bespoke training we use the following modus operandi:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>We work with your technical managers to tailor courses to
                your organizational needs.</li>
                <li>We engage with your organisation to learn more about the
                employees we'll be working with, their current skills and what
                they need to be able to deliver to your business.</li>
                <li>We provide consultation so that the training we deliver
                fits within your organization thus providing long term value
                from your employees.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you think we can help, drop us a line at the email address
