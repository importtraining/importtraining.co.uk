            <h1>Our Trainers</h1>
            <p>Both Nicholas and Peter have extensive backgrounds in software
            development, teaching and learning. We're both very active as
            developers and community members - we know stuff and we know
            the people who created the stuff you use. Most importantly, we both
            love what we do. We enjoy writing software and get a buzz from
            teaching. Out enthusiasm is infectious.</p>
