            <h1>Our Trainers</h1>
            <p>We (Nicholas and Peter) both have extensive backgrounds in
            software development, teaching and learning. We're also very
            active as developers and community members - we know stuff, we
            probably know the people who created the stuff you use and we talk
            about this stuff at conferences around the world. Most importantly,
            we both love what we do. We enjoy writing software and get a buzz
            from teaching. Our enthusiasm is infectious.</p>
